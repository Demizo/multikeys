Turn on word wrap.

These libraries are compiled from the xerces-c source, version 3.2, using cmake. Although Xerces is available in other ways, it's built manually in order to specify the /MT option to avoid dependencies on the VC++ Redistributable.
The source code for Xerces is not provided in this repository; only the output from its build.
The following commands are used to build each of them:

(at the xerces-c folder)
mkdir <somedir>

cd <somedir>

cmake . -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\<output directory> -DCMAKE_FLAGS_RELEASE=/MT

cmake --build . --config Release --target install

When building in x64, "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" is used instead.
When building the debug libraries, --config Debug is used instead.
I recommend keeping a separate folder for building the 32-bit and the 64-bit libraries.
The release version of these libraries are compiled using the /MT option in order to not depend on any VC++ Redistributables.

The folders contained in this directory must not be named "Debug", "Release", or some other names because the .gitignore will ignore them. Instead, $(Platform)_$(Configuration) should be used to find them. Also, the bin and lib folders inside them need to be specifically excluded in the gitignore.
