### Documentation

I originally developed Multikeys as my graduation project at FATEC Mogi das Cruzes (SP, Brazil); the file "Multikeys V1.0_pt-br.pdf" is the file I submitted there, complete with all errors :)  
Since then, I've corrected mistakes and translated the whole thing into English. That's the "Multikeys V1.1_en.pdf" file, which I recommend you use instead of the original.  
The biggest thing missing from V1.1 are translated images. Aside from that, please keep in mind that there's way too much irrelevant content in that document, so feel free to ignore half of it.
